## Possible Versus Probable and the Proof for God
- Open with story about lightning striking perfectly in a Z, or people getting into spiritualism occult situations like scientology -- they must experience something to convince them.
- Belief a priori to proof. C.S. Lewis -- faith then miracles, not miracles then faith.
- Use Near Death experiences from Upward Yearning of the Soul, the powerful and occult saying they received power from spiritual entities -- need proof that scenarios unexplainable by "comfort from ideology/religion". Michael Knowles psychic interview also. Exorcisms. Evolution/abiogenesis chances. "It's just luck" can explain anything, or also justify imminence philosophy where cause-effect don't exist -- cite philosopher. Fatima.
- Proof: most rational answer only conceivable to not include the spiritual if you preclude God from the start. When open minded between a spiritual cause and not a spiritual cause, it's more rational to think spirtiuality caused the event.
- Not God of Gaps because we exhaust naturalistic explanations.
